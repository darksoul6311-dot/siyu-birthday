Dear Siyu, <br><br>
From the moment you came into my life, I truly started living my life. I love you so much, Siyu.

I wanted to make your day as special as I possibly can. I wanted to give you so many things  not just gift  , but also warm hugs   , forehead kisses  ,  I want to cut the cake  with you, to stand in front of you and give you all the happiness   that I can.
I can’t promise things that aren’t possible for me right now, but a few days ago I promised you a gift finfect  a special gift  you asked me for. And here it is. 

I may not be able to send something expensive, but this gift comes with all my love and effort.  It may look small , but it’s the best I can give you from my heart. 
Now please smile for yourself, Siyu . I want to see you happy. 

I know your birthdays haven’t always been good or memorable. You don’t need to remember those moments. Forget everything which make you to feel bad.Let, celebrate your birthday with me, your brother, your good friends, your mom and your dad, and most importantly  with happiness.  

I truly want to make this birthday memorable for you forever. I’ve put all my efforts into making you smile today, and into making this celebration something we’ll always remember.
If you don’t smile, all my efforts feel incomplete ,because my biggest wish is to see you happy. So please smile, Jaana . 
